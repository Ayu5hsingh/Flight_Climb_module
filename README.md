## 📁 Project Structure


## 🚀 Question 1: Fuel Flow Modeling

### Problem Statement
Analyze simulated flight signals to build predictive models for fuel consumption based on aircraft operational parameters.

### Data Characteristics
- **Format**: Pandas DataFrames stored as pickle files
- **Structure**: 
  - Rows (index): Time vectors (variable length per flight)
  - Columns: Individual flight recordings
- **Parameters**:
  - Fuel Flow: pounds per second
  - Altitude: feet
  - Speed: kilometers per hour
  - Wind: knots

### Modeling Objectives

#### Model 1: Speed-Based Fuel Flow
- **Fixed Parameter**: Altitude at 8,000 ft
- **Variable**: Speed (effective range)
- **Analysis**: Relationship between airspeed and fuel consumption at cruise altitude

#### Model 2: Altitude-Based Fuel Flow
- **Fixed Parameter**: Speed at 665 km/h
- **Variable**: Altitude (0-15,000 ft range)
- **Analysis**: Impact of climb/descent phases on fuel efficiency

#### Model 3 (Bonus): Multi-Variable Model
- **Variables**: Both speed and altitude
- **Goal**: Comprehensive fuel flow prediction across operational envelope

### Key Questions Addressed
- Feature selection and engineering for time-series flight data
- Handling variable-length temporal sequences
- Wind speed considerations (and why it may be excluded)
- Model validation for aviation safety applications

## 📦 Question 2: Production Pipeline

### 2.1 Python Package Development
**Objective**: Transform ML module into installable Python package

**Deliverable**: `.tar.gz` archive installable via pip

**Key Components**:
- Modular code structure
- Proper package metadata
- Dependency management
- Installation scripts

### 2.2 Flask API Development
**Objective**: Create RESTful interface for ML models

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Parameters |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check | None |
| `/functions` | GET | List available functions | None |
| `/process` | POST | Generic ML pipeline | `n_samples`, `n_features`, `problem` |
| `/classification/process` | POST | Classification workflow | `n_samples`, `n_features` |
| `/regression/process` | POST | Regression workflow | `n_samples`, `n_features` |

**Response Format**: JSON with model statistics, error metrics, and predictions

### 2.3 Docker Containerization
**Objective**: Package API for production deployment

**Deliverables**:

- Production-ready configuration

### 2.4 Scalability Considerations
**Challenge**: Handle high-concurrency API access

**Solutions Evaluated**:
- **Gunicorn**: Multi-worker WSGI server
- **uWSGI**: High-performance application server
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue for async processing
- **FastAPI**: Async-native alternative to Flask
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for horizontal scaling


## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

- Complex non-linear interactions with other parameters
- Potential multicollinearity with ground/air speed
- Limited predictive power in controlled models

### Model Selection Rationale
- Linear regression for interpretability in safety-critical systems
- Polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

## 🚦 Future Enhancements
